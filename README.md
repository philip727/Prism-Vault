# About
Prism Vault is a passion project to help with grinding Warframe, it doesn't directly interact with the Warframe API as that is against Warframe's TOS. As someone who does not use overwolf I thought it'd be nice to have an alternative to other companion apps. Unfortunately, there will be no way to directly interact with your inventory and will have to be updated manually. Use it to track your prime inventory and make sales fast on the warframe market!
